In the jungle there was a mighty cat. The cat roared loudly and frightened the bats. The bats scattered about, waiting to regroup. Little did they know, a hawk had set sight on the bat tribe, and would soon be in for a feast.
The hawk hunted and preyed on the bats predaciously, inviting the scorn of the illhearted. But nature is brutal and leaves no room for those who do not work for themselves.
The caterpillar waddled about. It decided to eat a nice leaf. Eventually the caterpillar grew tired of leaves and started eating books.

The next day the caterpillar was nice and round and was ready to turn into a butterfly. It spun its thread and turned into a nice fluffy pupa and was ready to hibernate while it transformed.
But the question remained... would the caterpillar turn into a moth or a butterfly?
