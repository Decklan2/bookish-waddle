In the recesses of our minds, what thoughts do we have? When the school gives us free time, what do we do? Play? Pray? I've never heard of any kid who prayed during recess.
That is the time called 'youth' when you are too young to choose your own fate. All you can do is rely on when the adults think you should have time. If they stop caring for you, you're screwed.
Screwed as you may be, you may have more freedom. Caring is a burden. Limiting yourself to limitations.
